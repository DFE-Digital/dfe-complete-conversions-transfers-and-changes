# DfE: Complete conversions, transfers and changes

As a digital service being developed in DfE we aim to follow the
[DfE Technical Guidance](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/).

## Environments

- [development](https://dev.complete.education.gov.uk)
- [test](https://test.complete.education.gov.uk)
- [production](https://complete.education.gov.uk)

Console and logs can be accessed on all three environments, details are in
[accessing console and logs](/doc/console-and-logs.md)

## Getting started

If this is your first time running the application, see the
[`getting started documentation`](/doc/getting-started.md) for instructions.

## Day to day development

There are [developer scripts](/doc/developer-scripts.md) to make working on the
code straight forward for those that would like to use them.
