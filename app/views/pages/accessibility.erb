    <p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement applies to Complete
      conversions, transfers and changes.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This website is run by the Department for Education
      (DfE). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.
      For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the
        most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">We've also made the website text as simple as possible
      to understand.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this website is</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the
      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due 
      to the following non-compliance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="govuk-body">Some links are coded to visually appear as
            buttons so they may not have the expected behaviour for keyboard
            only users. A work around is to try the interacting with them as if
            they were links.</p>
        </li>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some buttons are coded to visually appear as

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="govuk-body">Abbreviations of Church of England, such as C of 
          E, in school names appear as "cofe". This appears as one word to sighted 
          users and assistive technology like screen readers. That means screen 
          readers may announce what should say C of E as a single word. This is due 
          to a known issue in the Get Information About Schools service. That 
          team will resolve it.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
