              You should aim to do this in the first week of picking up the project.

            guidance_text: |
              Your introductory email should have included some possible dates for a kick-off meeting.

              Once the school have got back to you with a suitable date and list of attendees, send out invites to arrange the time, date and location of the meeting. Itâ€™s likely to be a video call over Microsoft Teams.

              Some schools and trusts may prefer to have a 1-to-1 call with you, rather than a meeting involving all stakeholders.

          - title: Host the kick-off meeting or call
            hint: Make sure all attendees understand what they need to do, and when they need to do it by, to complete the conversion on time.

        guidance_summary: Help to clear a Land questionnaire
        guidance_text: |
          You must [check the school is using the right Land questionnaire (opens in a new tab)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-land-questionnaires). There are four different types.

          You need to clear the land questionnaire before the Master funding agreement and the Supplemental funding agreement.

          The Land questionnaire is critical. It is the basis for all land decisions.

          The answers given inform how the land will be treated. It decides which leases, directions and other land agreements are needed.

        guidance_summary: Help checking the Land registry title plans
        guidance_text: |
          Check you have an official copy of the title plans. An official copy will state that it's from the Land Registry, include a title plan and title number.

          It's a good idea to look at the site on Google maps and compare that to the title plan. This can help you find out if there's anything to question on the title plan.

          The boundary should include all school or trust buildings. If the land has become unregistered you should check the title plan.

          Talk to your line manager or the relevant solicitor if you have questions about anything on the title plan.

          If the trust uses a pre-2018 Master funding agreement, they have two options.

          They can update to a 2020 version of the Master funding agreement and update any pre-2018 Supplemental funding agreements in the trust too.

          Alternatively, they can adopt an additional 2020 Master funding agreement which the new academy's Supplemental funding agreement will sit under. This will allow the rest of the academies in the trust to stay under the pre-2018 Master funding agreement.

          You will need to clear any new and updated documents. These may need a Deed of variation.

        guidance_text: |
          A Trust modification order is used when a voluntary or foundation school's land is held by a trust or foundation that is not a diocese.
