There are templates for the school or trust, their solicitors and the local authority.
          This will help you to:

          * organise kick-off meetings
          * clarify roles and expectations
          * establish dates and deadlines
          * provide links to documents that need to be completed
          * agree ways of working

          You should aim to do this in the first week of picking up the project.

          Ideally the kick-off meeting should take place within the first couple
          of weeks.

          What to do if you don't have the local authority proforma
        guidance_text: |
          The regional delivery officer should have sent the local authority
          proforma to the local authority to complete.

          If you have not received it yet, check that the regional delivery
          officer sent it and then ask the local authority if they have
          completed and shared it.
      - title: Confirm the provisional conversion date with the local authority

          What to do if the local authority does not have capacity
        guidance_text: |
          The trust will have given a provisional date they want to convert on.

          Tell them if the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the
          provisional date.

          If the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the
          provisional date, you'll need to work with the trust and local authority to agree a new date.

        guidance_summary: How to arrange the kick-off meeting
        guidance_text: |
          Your introductory email should have included some possible dates for a
           kick-off meeting.

          Once the trust have got back to you with a suitable date and list of
          attendees, send out invites to arrange the time, date and location of
          the meeting. It's likely to be a video call over Microsoft Teams.

          Some trusts may prefer to have a 1-to-1 call with you, rather than a
          meeting involving all stakeholders.

          All schools that are issued a Directive academy order are allocated
          to an experienced trust. These trusts are also known as sponsors.

          In most cases, the sponsor is entitled to the Fast track grant.

          The sponsor will get:

          * £70,000 for primary and special schools
          * £80,000 for secondary and all-through schools

          In some circumstances, the sponsor might be entitled to a larger
          grant.

          This would be the Intermediate grant, or the Full sponsored grant.

          Intermediate grant amounts are:

          * £90,000 for primary and special schools
          * £115,000 for secondary and all-through schools

          Full sponsored grant amounts are:

          * £110,000 for primary and special schools
          * £150,000 secondary and all-through schools

          All grants include the £25,000 conversion grant. This is used to fund
          conversion costs, such as legal expenses. Any amount left after
          conversion costs have been paid for should be used for school
          improvements.

          A business case must be approved at advisory board, or by the regional
          director, for a trust to get the Intermediate or Full sponsored grant.

          The sponsor can claim for the Fast track grant first, then apply for
