          * clarify roles and expectations
          * establish dates and deadlines
          * provide links to documents that need to be completed
          * agree ways of working

          You should aim to do this in the first week of picking up the project.

          Ideally the kick-off meeting should take place within the first couple of weeks.

        guidance_text: |
          The regional delivery officer should have sent the local authority proforma to the local authority to complete.

          If you have not received it yet, check that the regional delivery officer sent it and then ask the local authority if they have completed and shared it.
      - title: Confirm the provisional conversion date with the local authority

          What to do if the local authority does not have capacity
        guidance_text: |
          The trust will have given a provisional date they want to convert on.

          Tell them if the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the provisional date.

          If the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the provisional date, you'll need to work with the trust and local authority to agree a new date.

          Once the trust have got back to you with a suitable date and list of attendees, send out invites to arrange the time, date and location of the meeting. It's likely to be a video call over Microsoft Teams.

          Some trusts may prefer to have a 1-to-1 call with you, rather than a meeting involving all stakeholders.
