          You can [choose an email template (opens in new tab)](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Shared%20Documents/Operational%20Delivery/Training%20and%20Resources/Resources/Project%20templates?csf=1&web=1&e=Hf4exC) to help you write your introductory emails. There are templates for the school or trust, their solicitors and the local authority.
          This will help you to:

          * organise kick-off meetings
          * clarify roles and expectations
          * establish dates and deadlines
          * provide links to documents that need to be completed
          * agree ways of working

          You should aim to do this in the first week of picking up the project.

          Ideally the kick-off meeting should take place within the first couple of weeks.

          The regional delivery officer should have sent the local authority proforma to the local authority to complete.

          What to do if the local authority does not have capacity
        guidance_text: |
          The trust will have given a provisional date they want to convert on.

          Tell them if the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the provisional date.

          If the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the provisional date, you'll need to work with the trust and local authority to agree a new date.
      - title: Send invites to the kick-off meeting or call
        hint: Check who the trust would like to attend the kick-off meeting.
        guidance_summary: How to arrange the kick-off meeting
        guidance_text: |
          Your introductory email should have included some possible dates for a kick-off meeting.

          Once the trust have got back to you with a suitable date and list of attendees, send out invites to arrange the time, date and location of the meeting. It's likely to be a video call over Microsoft Teams.

          Some trusts may prefer to have a 1-to-1 call with you, rather than a meeting involving all stakeholders.
