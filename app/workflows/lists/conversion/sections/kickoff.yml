      - title: Send introductory emails
        hint: |

        guidance_text: |
          You can [choose an email template (opens in new tab)](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Shared%20Documents/Operational%20Delivery/Training%20and%20Resources/Resources/Project%20templates?csf=1&web=1&e=Hf4exC) to help you write your introductory emails. There are templates for the school or trust, their solicitors and the local authority.

          This will help you to:

          * organise kick-off meetings
          * clarify roles and expectations
          * establish dates and deadlines
          * provide links to documents that need to be completed
          * agree ways of working

          You should aim to do this in the first week of picking up the project.
          Ideally the kick-off meeting should take place within the first couple of weeks.

        hint:
          Check that the local authority has capacity to convert the school by

          What to do if the local authority does not have capacity
        guidance_text: |

          Tell them if the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the target date.

          Some schools and trusts may prefer to have a 1-to-1 call with you, rather than a meeting involving all stakeholders.

      - title: Host the kick-off meeting or call

          Share the link with them so they can register if needed.

      - title: Check and confirm the school's grant eligibility

        guidance_text: |
          Usually, a converting school will be eligible for a Â£25,000 grant to help with the costs of becoming an academy.

          If the school has applied to become an academy in the past but not completed the process, they may already have been given some of the money.

          Check in the school's SharePoint folder to see if a Grant claim form has been submitted before.

          You can also email the Grant payments team at [CFUGrantPayments.REGIONSGROUP@education.gov.uk](mailto:CFUGrantPayments.REGIONSGROUP@education.gov.uk) to check if the school has previously received any money, and how much they're still eligible for.

          You must include this information in your email to the Grant payments team later.
