        guidance_text: |
          The Academies Operational Practice Unit will usually email the
          Baseline spreadsheet to you in the first week of each month.

          The project should be on the Regional Casework Services Baseline
          spreadsheet. This contains a list of all the schools expected to open
          as academies the following month, across all regions.

          Check the Regional Casework Services Baseline spreadsheet to confirm:

          * your school is on it
          * the information about the school is correct

          Enter yes if the project is on track to convert, or no if it will not
          open on the target date.

          **What to do if your school is not on the Baseline**

          There is one Baseline spreadsheet for each region. These are only used
          by regional delivery officers.

          Sometimes Regional Casework Services projects will show in the
          regional Baseline spreadsheets by accident.

          If this happens, remove your school from the regional Baseline
          spreadsheet and add it to the Regional Casework Services Baseline
          spreadsheet.

          If it doesn't appear at all, enter the school's information in the
          correct Baseline spreadsheet.

          Email the Academy Operational Practice Unit at [academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk](mailto:academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk) to tell them if you have had to move or add the school to the correct Baseline.

          not. You do not need to go into detail.

          Things you'll need to check to confirm if all conditions have been met
          include:

          * commercial transfer agreement signed
          * leases agreed and signed

        guidance_summary: What to tell the school

          * confirmation the school will convert on the target date
          * the school's new URN (unique reference number)
          * all signed and sealed legal documents
          * the [Grant expenditure certificate (opens in a new tab)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-support-grant) that they need to complete and return

          It can be helpful to mention that they'll soon get some welcome emails from other teams in government. These will contain more information about funding and opening as an academy.

          You can split this information over more than one email if you don't immediately have everything you need.
