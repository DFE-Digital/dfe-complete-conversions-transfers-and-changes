          The Academies Operational Practice Unit will usually email the Baseline
          spreadsheet to you in the first week of each month.

          The Baseline spreadsheet contains a list of all the schools expected to open as
          academies the following month. The school should appear on that list.

          The Academies Operational Practice Unit may refer to the Baseline as the
          Openers list.

          ### What to do if your school is not on the Baseline

          There is a Baseline spreadsheet for each region. If the school does not appear
          in the right Baseline check the other Baselines to see if the school has been
          added to the wrong one.

          If the school is in the wrong region, remove it from that Baseline and place
          the information in the correct region.

          If it doesn't appear at all, enter the school's information in the correct
          Baseline spreadsheet.

          Email the Academy operations team to tell them if you have had to move or add
          the school to the correct Baseline.
