        guidance_text: |
          The Academies Operational Practice Unit will usually email the Baseline
          spreadsheet to you in the first week of each month.

          The Baseline spreadsheet contains a list of all the schools expected to open as
          academies the following month. The school should appear on that list.

          The Academies Operational Practice Unit may refer to the Baseline as the
          Openers list.

          ### What to do if your school is not on the Baseline

          There is a Baseline spreadsheet for each region. If the school does not appear
          in the right Baseline check the other Baselines to see if the school has been
          added to the wrong one.

          If the school is in the wrong region, remove it from that Baseline and place
          the information in the correct region.

          If it doesn't appear at all, enter the school's information in the correct
          Baseline spreadsheet.

          Email the Academy operations team to tell them if you have had to move or add
          the school to the correct Baseline.

          Depending on the scale of the outstanding tasks, you may need to move the target conversion date to the next month, or later.

          If the conversion date needs to be moved, you must:

          1. inform the school of the outstanding tasks
          2. agree a new target conversion date
          3. tell the Academies Operational Practice Unit by email

        guidance_summary: How to confirm if conditions have been met
        guidance_text: |

          You must email the Academies Operational Practice Unit at
          [academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk](academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk)
          to confirm if all conditions are met for this school and it will open
          as an academy on the target conversion date.

          The email only needs to confirm if all conditions have been met, or
          not. You do not need to go into detail.

          Things you'll need to check to confirm if all conditions have been met
          include:

          * commercial transfer agreement signed
          * leases agreed and signed
          * risk protection arrangement in place and insurer confirmed
          * relevant documents signed and sealed

          ### What to do if conditions are not met

          All conditions must be met before a school can open as an academy.

          If there are outstanding conditions, you must:

          * inform the school of the outstanding tasks
          * agree a new target conversion date
          * tell the Academies Operational Practice Unit by email
          at [academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk](mailto:academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk).
          * remove the school from the Baseline
          * change the date in KIM
          * inform the regional delivery officer who started on this project

          Usually, the date will be moved to the first day of the next month.
          Sometimes you may find that the school and trust need more time. You
          can move the opening to a later date if needed.

          If the opening date changes, any documents that reference the opening
          date will need to be updated and re-signed.

  - title: Confirm opening date with the school
    hint: |
      Once you've confirmed that all conditions have been met, contact the
      school and trust to tell them they can convert on the target conversion
      date.

    actions:
      - title: Email relevant information to your main contact
        guidance_summary: What to tell the school
        guidance_text: |
          Email your main contact at the school or trust.

          Your email should include:

          * confirmation the school will convert on the target date
          * the school's new URN (unique reference number)
          * all signed and sealed legal documents
          * the [Grant expenditure certificate (opens in a new tab)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-support-grant) that they need to complete and return

          It can be helpful to mention that they'll soon get some welcome emails from other teams in government. These will contain more information about funding and opening as an academy.

          You can split this information over more than one email if you don't immediately have everything you need.
