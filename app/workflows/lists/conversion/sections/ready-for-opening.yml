        guidance_summary: How to check the Baseline
        guidance_text: |
          The Academies Operational Practice Unit will usually email the
          Baseline spreadsheet to you in the first week of each month.

          Your projects should be on the Regional Casework Services Baseline
          spreadsheet. This contains a list of all the schools expected to open
          as academies the following month, across all regions.

          Check the Regional Casework Services Baseline spreadsheet to confirm:

          * your school is on it
          * the information about the school is correct

          Enter yes if the project is on track to convert, or no if it will not
          open on the target date.

          **What to do if your school is not on the Baseline**

          There is one Baseline spreadsheet for each region. These are only used
          by regional delivery officers.

          Sometimes Regional Casework Services projects will show in the
          regional Baseline spreadsheets by accident.

          If this happens, remove your school from the regional Baseline
          spreadsheet and add it to the Regional Casework Services Baseline
          spreadsheet.

          If it doesn't appear at all, enter the school's information in the
          correct Baseline spreadsheet.

          Email the Academy Operational Practice Unit at [academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk](mailto:academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk) to tell them if you have had to move or add the school to the correct Baseline.

          Depending on the scale of the outstanding tasks, you may need to move the target conversion date to the next month, or later.

          If the conversion date needs to be moved, you must:

          1. inform the school of the outstanding tasks
          2. agree a new target conversion date
          3. tell the Academies Operational Practice Unit by email
          4. remove the school from the baseline
          5. change the date in KIM
          6. inform the regional delivery officer who started on this project

        guidance_summary: How to confirm if conditions have been met
        guidance_text: |

          You must email the Academies Operational Practice Unit at
          [academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk](academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk)
          to confirm if all conditions are met for this school and it will open
          as an academy on the target conversion date.

          The email only needs to confirm if all conditions have been met, or
          not. You do not need to go into detail.

          Things you'll need to check to confirm if all conditions have been met
          include:

          * commercial transfer agreement signed
          * leases agreed and signed
          * risk protection arrangement in place and insurer confirmed
          * relevant documents signed and sealed

          ### What to do if conditions are not met

          All conditions must be met before a school can open as an academy.

          If there are outstanding conditions, you must:

          * inform the school of the outstanding tasks
          * agree a new target conversion date
          * tell the Academies Operational Practice Unit by email
          at [academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk](mailto:academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk).
          * remove the school from the Baseline
          * change the date in KIM
          * inform the regional delivery officer who started on this project

          Usually, the date will be moved to the first day of the next month.
          Sometimes you may find that the school and trust need more time. You
          can move the opening to a later date if needed.

          If the opening date changes, any documents that reference the opening
          date will need to be updated and re-signed.

  - title: Confirm opening date with the school
    hint: |
      Once you've confirmed that all conditions have been met, contact the
      school and trust to tell them they can convert on the target conversion
      date.
    actions:
      - title: Email the school and share documents
        guidance_summary: What to tell the school
        guidance_text: |
          Email your main contact at the school or trust.

          Your email should include:

          * confirmation the school will convert on the target date
          * the school's new URN (unique reference number)
          * all signed and sealed legal documents

          You also need give them a Grant expenditure certificate and tell them to complete it.

          It can be helpful to mention that they'll soon get some welcome
          emails from other teams in government. These will contain more
          information about funding and opening as an academy.
