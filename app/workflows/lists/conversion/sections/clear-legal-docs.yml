          You must [check the school is using the right Land questionnaire (opens in a new tab)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-land-questionnaires).

          You need to clear the Land questionnaire before the Master funding agreement and the Supplemental funding agreement.

          The Land questionnaire is critical. It is the basis for all land decisions.

          The answers given inform how the land will be treated. It decides which leases, directions and other land agreements are needed.

          Check you have an official copy of the title plans. An official copy will state that it's from the Land Registry, include a title plan and title number.

          It's a good idea to look at the site on Google maps and compare that to the title plan. This can help you find out if there's anything to question on the title plan.

          The boundary should include all school or trust buildings. If the land has become unregistered you should check the title plan.

          Talk to your line manager or the relevant solicitor if you have questions about anything on the title plan.

          If the trust uses a Master funding agreement from 2018 or earlier, they have two options.

          They can update to a 2020 version of the Master funding agreement and update any Supplementary funding agreements from 2018 or earlier in the trust too.

          Alternatively, they can adopt an additional Master funding agreement, from 2020, which the new academy's Supplementary funding agreement will sit under. This will allow the rest of the academies in the trust to continue using the existing Master funding agreement.

          You will need to clear any new and updated documents. These may need a Deed of variation.
