          - title: Send introductory emails
            hint:
              Introduce yourself to the school, trust and their solicitors. You
              should also contact the local authority, but do this separately.
            guidance_summary: What to include in introductory emails
            guidance_text: |
              You can [choose an email template (opens in new tab)](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Shared%20Documents/Operational%20Delivery/Training%20and%20Resources/Resources/Project%20templates?csf=1&web=1&e=Hf4exC) to help you write your introductory emails. There are templates for the school or trust, their solicitors and the local authority.

              This will help you to:

              * organise kick-off meetings
              * clarify roles and expectations
              * establish dates and deadlines
              * provide links to documents that need to be completed
              * agree ways of working

              You should aim to do this in the first week of picking up the project.
              Ideally the kick-off meeting should take place within the first couple of weeks.

          - title: Check and save the Local authority proforma in SharePoint
            guidance_summary: Help with the Local authority proforma
            guidance_text: |
              The regional delivery officer should have sent the Local authority proforma to the local authority to complete.

              If you haven't received it yet, check that the regional delivery officer sent it and then ask the local authority if they have completed and shared it.

          - title: Confirm the target conversion date with the local authority
            hint:
              Check that the local authority has capacity to convert the school

            guidance_summary:
              What to do if the local authority does not have capacity
            guidance_text: |
              The school and trust will have given a target date they want to convert on.

              Tell them if the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the target date.

              If the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the target date, you'll need to work with the school, trust and local authority to agree a new date.

          - title: Send invites to the kick-off meeting or call
            hint:
              Check who the school and trust would like to attend the kick-off
              meeting.
            guidance_summary: How to arrange the kick-off meeting
            guidance_text: |
              Your introductory email should have included some possible dates for a kick-off meeting.

              Once the school have got back to you with a suitable date and list of attendees, send out invites to arrange the time, date and location of the meeting. It's likely to be a video call over Microsoft Teams.

              Some schools and trusts may prefer to have a 1-to-1 call with you, rather than a meeting involving all stakeholders.

          - title: Host the kick-off meeting or call
            hint:
              Make sure all attendees understand what they need to do, and when
              they need to do it by.
            guidance_summary: What to talk about in the meeting
            guidance_text: |
              You should discuss and record issues that might complicate or delay the project.

              You can use the [conversion checklist (opens in a new tab)](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/EU-dQwiXf3NFmiPoiRABB_MBhO02xGbkBlhSifmDGiAnGA?e=Q9XOkA) to guide the conversation and make sure you talk about everything you need to.

      - title: Process conversion grant
        guidance_summary: How to process a conversion grant
        guidance_text: |
          Check the grant claim form is ready, the school or trust has a vendor account and send the correct information to the Grant payments team.

          Start this as soon as possible. Schools and trusts can start getting charged by solicitors and the local authority early in the process.

        actions:
          - title: Check the school or trust have a vendor account
            hint: |
              You can [check if the school or trust has a vendor account (opens in new tab)](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvedfe00083/SitePages/Set-up-and-mainta.aspx) on SharePoint.

            guidance_text: |
              The school or trust receiving the conversion grant must have a vendor account.

              Schools and trusts can [set up a vendor account (opens in new tab)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provide-information-about-your-banking-and-payments-to-dfe) when they provide information about their banking and payments to DfE.

              Share the link with them so they can register if needed.

              It can take 15 to 20 days for an account to be created.

          - title: Check and confirm the school's grant eligibility
            hint:
              A school may have already had some of the grant if they've tried
              to become an academy before.
            guidance_summary: How to check grant eligibility
            guidance_text: |
              Usually, a converting school will be eligible for a £25,000 grant to help with the costs of becoming an academy.

              If the school has applied to become an academy in the past but not completed the process, they may already have been given some of the money.

              Check in the school's SharePoint folder to see if a Grant claim form has been submitted before.

              You can also email the Grant payments team at [CFUGrantPayments.REGIONSGROUP@education.gov.uk](mailto:CFUGrantPayments.REGIONSGROUP@education.gov.uk) to check if the school has previously received any money, and how much they’re still eligible for.

              You must include this information in your email to the Grant payments team later.

          - title: Receive, check and save the grant claim form
            hint: Make sure there's no missing information.
            guidance_summary: How to check and save the form

              claim form.
            guidance_summary: Guidance on what information to send
            guidance_text: |
              You'll find the Academy order, Application to convert and Grant claim form in the school's SharePoint folder.

              You should send the documents to the Grant payments team by email at [CFUGrantPayments.REGIONSGROUP@education.gov.uk](mailto:CFUGrantPayments.REGIONSGROUP@education.gov.uk).

              The subject line of the email must include the:

              * region the school is in
              * grant type (converter grant)
              * school's name

              The content of the email must include the:

              * type of grant needed
              * amount of money the school is eligible for
              * school's name
              * trust it's joining
              * target conversion date

              It's helpful to include the school or trust's vendor account number too. The Grant payments team will need this to be able to send the money to whoever will receive it.

          - title: Give the school and trust the grant payment date
            hint: The Grant payments team will confirm the date with you first.

          - title: Check the school or trust have received the grant
            hint:
              Get in touch with the school or trust the month after you contact
              the Grant payments team.

        guidance_text: |
          You must [check the school is using the right Land questionnaire (opens in a new tab)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-land-questionnaires). There are four different types.

          You need to clear the land questionnaire before the Master funding agreement and the Supplemental funding agreement.

          The Land questionnaire is critical. It is the basis for all land decisions.

          The answers given inform how the land will be treated. It decides which leases, directions and other land agreements are needed.

        guidance_text: |
          Check you have an official copy of the title plans. An official copy will state that it's from the Land Registry, include a title plan and title number.

          It's a good idea to look at the site on Google maps and compare that to the title plan. This can help you find out if there's anything to question on the title plan.

          The boundary should include all school or trust buildings. If the land has become unregistered you should check the title plan.

          Talk to your line manager or the relevant solicitor if you have questions about anything on the title plan.

          If the trust uses a pre-2018 Master funding agreement, they have two options.

          They can update to a 2020 version of the Master funding agreement and update any pre-2018 Supplemental funding agreements in the trust too.

          Alternatively, they can adopt an additional 2020 Master funding agreement which the new academy's Supplemental funding agreement will sit under. This will allow the rest of the academies in the trust to stay under the pre-2018 Master funding agreement.

          You will need to clear any new and updated documents. These may need a Deed of variation.
