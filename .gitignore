## IMPORTANT ##
#
# Usually a pattern here also belongs in your `.dockerignore` file and vice
# versa.
#
# Note that Docker's ignore syntax is slightly different to Git's. The main
# difference is that Git interprets patterns without a leading slash as applying
# to any subdirectory, while Docker interprets them as relative to the project
# root directory. To resolve that, a `.dockerignore` should prefix those
# patterns with `**/`. This is also compatible with Git.
#
## How to use this file
#
# Add patterns to the section they apply to, sorted by:
#
#   1. absolute paths to or patterns for files (with a `/` prefix)
#   2. absolute paths to or patterns for directories
#   3. relative paths to or patterns for files (without a `/` prefix)
#   4. relative paths to or patterns for directories
#   5. pattern exceptions (sorted as above)
#
# Sort them alphanumerically within each section.
#
# If no section fits, create one. No path or pattern should exist without a
# section or label.
#

## Sensitive files
#
# To override these ignored files on a case-by-case basis,
# instead of adding a rule to this file, force add them:
#
# ```
# git add path/to/file --force
# ```
#
# This reduces the risk of accidentally committing files that happen to match
# the ignore pattern exception, or a file being removed and readded
# unintentionally in the future.
