# 20. Keep search simple

Date: 2023-09-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Search is a valuable feature for any user which we would like to offer. There
are many ways to approach this from the very simple to incredibly complicated.

## Decision

We will keep our approach simple in both the needs it will be able to meet and
it's implementation, to deliver as much value for the least effort and technical
overhead.

## Consequences

We will only be able to offer search on data we hold in our database tables,
right now, those neatly align to the needs we've already identified with our
users once we can access GIAS data without the Academies API.

We may reach the point where our simple approach can no longer meet new needs of
users and we may have to change the approach.
