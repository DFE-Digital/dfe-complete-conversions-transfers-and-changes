            <p>This is where you make sure everyone involved in the transfer knows what they need to do, and when to do it, so the academy can transfer on time.</p>
            <p>This is also a good opportunity to talk about common problems and how to avoid them.</p>

              <p>You can <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB09ACD14-DB17-4AEC-8E72-589553B85CB9%7D&file=TRANSFERS_Trust_Email_Template.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true" target="_blank">choose an email template (opens in new tab)</a> to help you write your introductory emails. There are templates for the outgoing trust, incoming trust and their solicitors.</p>
              <p>This will help you to:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>organise kick-off meetings</li>
              <li>clarify roles and expectation</li>
              <li>establish dates and deadlines</li>
              <li>provide links to documents that need to be completed</li>
              <li>agree ways of working</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You should aim to do this in the first week after you have been assigned the project.</p>
              <p>Ideally the kick-off meeting should take place within the first 2 weeks.</p>

          guidance:
            html:
              <p>You should have included possible dates for the kick-off meeting in your introductory email.</p>
              <p>Once the trusts have got back to you with a suitable date and list of attendees, send out invites to arrange the time, date and location of the meeting. It's likely to be a video call over Microsoft Teams.</p>
              <p>Some trusts may prefer to have a one-to-one call with you, rather than a meeting involving all stakeholders.</p>
