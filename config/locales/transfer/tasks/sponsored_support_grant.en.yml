            <p>Transfer funding grants are only usually available in intervention cases.</p>
            <p>This includes transfers due to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>an inadequate rating in an Ofsted inspection</li>
              <li>intervention by DfE following at least 2 requires improvement ratings in Ofsted inspections</li>
              <li>intervention due to financial, governance or safeguarding concerns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Others transferring for other reasons may also be able to access this funding. This is judged on a case-by-case basis.</p>

        guidance:
          html:
            <p>Each eligible transfer will get £25,000 as a standard level of funding.</p>
            <p>This is adjusted if the academy transferring has a budget surplus. The incoming trust must use bugdet surplus to pay for transfer costs before using transfer grant funding.</p>
            <p>In some circumstances, they might be entitled to a larger grant. There are 3 levels of funding money that can be added to the transfer grant:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>fast track</li>
              <li>intermediate</li>
              <li>full sponsored</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following amounts all include the £25,000 basic level of transfer grant funding.</p>
            <p>Fast track grant amounts are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>£70,000 for primary and special academies</li>
              <li>£80,000 for secondary and all through academies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Intermediate grant amounts are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>£90,000 for primary and special academies</li>
              <li>£115,000 for secondary and all-through academies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Full sponsored grant amounts are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>£110,000 for primary and special academies</li>
              <li>£150,000 secondary and all-through academies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Any funding up to £100,000 must be approved by the director of the National Directorate.</p>
            <p>Any funding of £100,000 or more must be approved by the Director General for Regions Group.</p>

              html:
                <p>Confirm if the incoming trust will receive the standard transfer grant funding amout, or a higher level of fast track, intermediate or full sponsored grant.</p>
                <p>This can be changed later on if the trust finds they need more money.</p>

            guidance:
              html:
                <p>Trusts can discover new information that means they might need more funding than they first thought they would.</p>
                <p>When this happens, speak to your regional director. They will need to approve the new grant amount. You may need to write a business case for the additional funding.</p>
                <p>When the new funding is agreed and approved, the trust will need to complete a new grant claim form and send it to the grants team.</p>
                <p>You can then come back to this task and update the grant type information.</p>
