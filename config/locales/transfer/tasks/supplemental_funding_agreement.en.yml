          guidance:
            html:
              <p>Changes that personalise the model documents to an academy or trust, and remove or add optional clauses, are expected. The wording of clauses should not change.</p>
              <p>You'll need to <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00030/SitePages/Resources/Request%20for%20advice%20from%20the%20AOPU.aspx" target="_blank">contact the policy team (opens in new tab)</a> about changes to clause text.</p>
              <p>We only accept new supplemental funding agreements that use the 2020 edition of the model documents.</p>
              <p>Master funding agreements from 2018 onwards are compatible with supplemental funding agreements from 2020 onwards.</p>
