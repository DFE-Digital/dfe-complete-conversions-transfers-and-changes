          guidance:
            html:
              <p>All schools that are issued a directive academy order are allocated
              to an experienced trust. These trusts are also known as sponsors.</p>
              <p>In most cases, the sponsor is entitled to the fast track grant.</p>
              <p>The sponsor will get:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>£70,000 for primary and special schools</li>
              <li>£80,000 for secondary and all-through schools</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In some circumstances, the sponsor might be entitled to a larger
              grant.</p>
              <p>This would be the intermediate grant, or the full sponsored grant.</p>
              <p>Intermediate grant amounts are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>£90,000 for primary and special schools</li>
              <li>£115,000 for secondary and all-through schools</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Full sponsored grant amounts are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>£110,000 for primary and special schools</li>
              <li>£150,000 secondary and all-through schools</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All grants include the £25,000 conversion grant. This is used to fund
              conversion costs, such as legal expenses. Any amount left after
              conversion costs have been paid for should be used for school
              improvements.</p>
              <p>A business case must be approved at advisory board, or by the regional
              director, for a trust to get the intermediate or full sponsored grant.</p>
