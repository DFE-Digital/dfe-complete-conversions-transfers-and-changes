            <p>There are 3 levels of sponsored grant available to academies:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>fast track</li>
            <li>intermediate</li>
            <li>full sponsored</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Academies or their sponsor trust can only apply for one of these grant levels at first. The level of grant can be increased later on if necessary.</p>
            <p>These grants are only available to schools converting due to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>an inadequate rating in an Ofsted inspection</li>
            <li>intervention by DfE following at least 2 requires improvement ratings in Ofsted inspections</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Schools issued a directive academy order are automatically eligible for these grants. Others converting with an academy order may be able to access this funding too. This is judged on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <p>The fast track grant amounts are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>£70,000 for primary and special schools</li>
            <li>£80,000 for secondary and all-through schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In some circumstances, the sponsor might be entitled to a larger
            grant.</p>
            <p>This would be the intermediate grant, or the full sponsored grant.</p>
            <p>Intermediate grant amounts are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>£90,000 for primary and special schools</li>
            <li>£115,000 for secondary and all-through schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Full sponsored grant amounts are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>£110,000 for primary and special schools</li>
            <li>£150,000 secondary and all-through schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All grants include the £25,000 conversion support grant. This is used to fund
            conversion costs, such as legal expenses. Any amount left after
            conversion costs have been paid for should be used for school
            improvements.</p>
            <p>A business case must be approved at advisory board, or by the regional
            director, for a trust to get the intermediate or full sponsored grant.</p>

              html:
                <p>Trusts can discover new information that means they might need more funding than they first thought they would.</p>
                <p>When this happens, speak to your regional director. They will need to approve the new grant amount. You may need to write a business case for the additional funding.</p>
                <p>When the new funding is agreed and approved, the trust will need to complete a new grant claim form and send it to the grants team.</p>
                <p>You can then come back to this task and update the grant type information.</p>
