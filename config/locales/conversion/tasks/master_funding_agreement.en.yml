          hint:
            html: <p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-and-free-school-funding-agreements" target="_blank">view the model documents (opens in new tab)</a> to check for changes.</p>

          guidance:
            html:
              <p>Changes that personalise the model documents to a school or trust, and remove or add optional clauses, are expected. The wording of clauses should not change.</p>
              <p>You'll need to <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvedfe00116/SitePages/Commissioning%20Form.aspx" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">contact the policy team (opens in new tab)</a> about changes to clause text.</p>
              <p>If the trust uses a master funding agreement from 2018 or earlier, they have two options.</p>
              <p>They can update to a 2020 version of the master funding agreement and update any supplemental funding agreements from 2018 or earlier in the trust too.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, they can adopt an additional master funding agreement, from 2020, which the new academy's supplemental funding agreement will sit under. This will allow the rest of the academies in the trust to continue using the existing master funding agreement.</p>
              <p>You will need to clear any new and updated documents. These may need a deed of variation.</p>

          guidance:
            html:
              <p>The Secretary of State, or somebody with the authority to act on their behalf, must sign the master funding agreement.</p>
              <p>Usually this is your team leader or the deputy director.</p>
              <p>You only need to send the exact pages that they need to sign. Do not send the full document.</p>
              <p>Once you've received the signed page, put it back in the document. Then save the signed master funding agreement as a PDF in the school's SharePoint folder.</p>
