              <p>The subject line of the email must include the:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>region the school is in</li>
                <li>grant type (converter grant)</li>
                <li>school's name</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The content of the email must include the:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>type of grant needed</li>
