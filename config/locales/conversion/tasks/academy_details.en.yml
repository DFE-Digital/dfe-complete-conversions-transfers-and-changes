            <p>It must be confirmed at least 40 days before the academy opens.</p>
            <p>If the name needs to change after that point, you must email ADOP (Academy Delivery Operational Policy) as they will use this information to create the academy's URN (Unique Reference Number) and funding letters.</p>
