          html:
            <p>A tenancy at will allows a tenant and landlord to agree that the tenant can indefinitely use the land owned by the landlord.</p>
            <p>It's very rare that this document is used.</p>
            <p>It's only likely to be used when a trust and land owner are unable to resolve a land use issue through the usual leases, and the trust are happy to proceed at risk.</p>
