        hint:
          html:
            <p>A direction to transfer is only needed when freehold land is owned by a foundation school, governing body or trustees and that land needs to be transferred to the trust or diocese.</p>
            <p>You can <a href="https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Search" target="_blank">search Get Information About Schools (opens in new tab)</a> to check if it's needed for this school.</p>

          hint:
            html: 
              <p>Make sure information in the direction to transfer is correct and compare it against the model document.</p>
              <p>Once checked and cleared, you must send the direction to transfer to AOPU (Academy Operational Practice Unit) at <a href="mailto:academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk">academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk</a> for signing.</p>
              <p>This must be sent to them by the deadline they set in their monthly email. This is at the same time as you send the single worksheet.</p>
