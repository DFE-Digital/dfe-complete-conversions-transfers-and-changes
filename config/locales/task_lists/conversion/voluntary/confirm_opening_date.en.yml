            guidance:
              html:
                <p>Email your main contact at the school or trust.</p>
                <p>Your email should include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>confirmation the school will convert on the target date</li>
                  <li>the school's new URN (unique reference number)</li>
                  <li>all signed and sealed legal documents</li>
                  <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-support-grant" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">Grant expenditure certificate (opens in a new tab)</a> that they need to complete and return</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It can be helpful to mention that they'll soon get some welcome emails from other teams in government. These will contain more information about funding and opening as an academy.</p>
                <p>You can split this information over more than one email if you don't immediately have everything you need.</p>
