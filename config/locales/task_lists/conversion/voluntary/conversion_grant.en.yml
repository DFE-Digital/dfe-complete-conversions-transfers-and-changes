              html:
                <p>Usually, a converting school will be eligible for a £25,000 grant to help with the costs of becoming an academy.</p>
                <p>However, if the school has applied to become an academy in the past but not completed the process, they may have received some of the money then.</p>

                <p>Check in the school SharePoint folder to see if a Grant claim form has been submitted already.</p>
                <p>You can also email the Grant payments team at <a href="mailto:CFUGrantPayments.REGIONSGROUP@education.gov.uk">CFUGrantPayments.REGIONSGROUP@education.gov.uk</a> to check if the school has previously received any money, and how much they’re still eligible for.</p>
