              html:
                <p>Changes that personalise the model documents to a school or trust, and remove or add optional clauses, are expected. The wording of clauses should not change.</p>
                <p>You'll need to <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvedfe00116/SitePages/Commissioning%20Form.aspx" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">contact the policy team (opens in new tab)</a> about changes to clause text.</p>
                <p>We only accept new Supplemental funding agreements that use the 2020 edition of the model documents.</p>
                <p>Supplemental funding agreements from 2020 onwards and Master funding agreements from 2018 onwards are compatible.</p>
