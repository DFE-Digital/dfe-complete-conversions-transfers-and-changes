There are templates for the school or trust, their solicitors and the local authority.</p>

                <p>This will help you to:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>organise kick-off meetings</li>
                  <li>clarify roles and expectations</li>
                  <li>establish dates and deadlines</li>
                  <li>provide links to documents that need to be completed</li>
                  <li>agree ways of working</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You should aim to do this in the first week of picking up the project. Ideally the kick-off meeting should take place within the first couple of weeks.</p>
