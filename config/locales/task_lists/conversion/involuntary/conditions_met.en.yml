            guidance:
              html:
                <p>You must email the Academies Operational Practice Unit at <a href="mailto:academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk" target="_blank">academiesdelivery.operations@education.gov.uk</a> to confirm if all conditions are met for this school and it will open as an academy on the provisional conversion date.</p>
                <p>The email only needs to confirm if all conditions have been met, or not. You do not need to go into detail.</p>

                <ul>
                <li>commercial transfer agreement signed</li>
                <li>leases agreed and signed</li>
                <li>risk protection arrangement in place and insurer confirmed</li>
