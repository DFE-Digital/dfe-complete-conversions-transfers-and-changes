There are templates for the school or trust, their solicitors and the local authority.</p>

                <p>This will help you to:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>organise kick-off meetings</li>
                <li>clarify roles and expectations</li>
                <li>establish dates and deadlines</li>
                <li>provide links to documents that need to be completed</li>
                <li>agree ways of working</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You should aim to do this in the first week of picking up the project.</p>
                <p>Ideally the kick-off meeting should take place within the first couple of weeks.</p>

              html:
                <p>The regional delivery officer should have sent the local authority proforma to the local authority to complete.</p>
                <p>If you haven't received it yet, check that the regional delivery officer sent it and then ask the local authority if they have completed and shared it.</p>

            hint:

              html:
                <p>The trust will have given a provisional date they want to convert on.</p>
                <p>Tell them if the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the provisional date.</p>
                <p>If the local authority cannot complete the conversion by the provisional date, you'll need to work with the trust and local authority to agree a new date.</p>

            guidance:
              html:
                <p>Your introductory email should have included some possible dates for a kick-off meeting.</p>
                <p>Once the trust have got back to you with a suitable date and list of attendees, send out invites to arrange the time, date and location of the meeting. Itâ€™s likely to be a video call over Microsoft Teams.</p>
                <p>Some trusts may prefer to have a 1-to-1 call with you, rather than a meeting involving all stakeholders.</p>
