Description:
    Generates the files for a new voluntary conversion task

Example:
    bin/rails generate conversion_voluntary_task NameOfTask

    This will create:
        app/models/conversion/voluntary/tasks/name_of_task.rb
        app/views/conversion/voluntary/task_lists/tasks/name_of_task.html.erb
        db/migrate/date_add_name_of_task_task.rb
        config/locales/task_lists/conversion/voluntary/name_of_task.en.yml

    Add the new task to the Conversion::Voluntary::TaskList to include it.
