Description:
    Generates the files for a new transfer task, `TaskForm` is appended to the class name
    when necessary, do not include it.

Example:
    bin/rails generate transfer:task TaskName

    This will create:
        app/form/transfer/tasks/task_name_task_form.rb
        app/views/transfer/tasks/task_name/edit.html.erb
        config/locales/transfer/tasks/task_name.en.yml
        db/migrate/<datetime>_add_transfer_task_name_task_attributes

    Add the attributes to the migration and remember to prefix the names with the task name e.g. task_name_attribute_name.

    Add the new task to the transfer::TaskList to include the new task in the task list.
